## Smart Glass: Empowering the Visually Impaired

This chapter describes the design and functionality of the Smart Glass, a device developed to empower visually impaired individuals by converting printed text into audio. The system utilizes advanced technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to bridge accessibility gaps, enabling users to interact with printed materials effortlessly.

The Smart Glass leverages a Raspberry Pi 4 and Camera v2 to capture text, which is then processed using Tesseract OCR. The extracted text is converted to speech through a TTS engine, providing real-time auditory feedback via a speaker. The system is designed for simplicity and portability, featuring an intuitive push-button interface and a 3D-printed enclosure for ergonomic use.

- Features sufficient computational power for real-time processing.

#### 2. Camera v2:

- **Captures high-resolution images of printed text.**
- Provides clear input for OCR to improve recognition accuracy.

#### 3. Push Button:

- **Serves as the primary user input.**
- Initiates the image capture and text processing workflow with a single press.

#### 4. Speaker:

- **Outputs the audio generated by the TTS engine.**
- Ensures clear and audible feedback for the user.

#### 5. SD Card (32GB):

- **Stores the operating system, OCR software, and temporary image files.**

#### 6. 3D-Printed Enclosure:

- **Houses all components securely in a lightweight and ergonomic design.**
- Ensures durability and ease of use for the target audience.

#### 7. Power Source:

- **Powered via a USB cable connected to a power bank or wall adapter.**

### Software Implementation

The software implementation of the Smart Glass is designed to convert printed text into audible speech, enabling visually impaired individuals to interact with their surroundings. This is achieved through the integration of Tesseract OCR for text recognition and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, supported by efficient preprocessing and system control mechanisms.

#### Key Software Components:

**1. Tesseract OCR:**

- **Extracts text from images captured by the Camera v2.**
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for recognizing printed text in various fonts and sizes.
- Enhanced by preprocessing techniques to improve recognition accuracy.

**2. pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech):**

- **Converts the extracted text into audible speech for the user.**
- Operates offline, ensuring consistent functionality without internet dependency.
- Allows customization of speech rate, volume, and voice properties.

**3. GPIO Integration:**

- **Detects button presses to trigger the text recognition and speech workflow.**
- Uses Raspberry Pi GPIO pins configured for simple and responsive control.

**4. Image Preprocessing:**

- **Prepares captured images for OCR by resizing and enhancing them using the Pillow library.**
- Ensures consistent input quality for improved text recognition.

**5. Threading:**

- **Ensures a responsive system by handling tasks like image processing and speech synthesis concurrently.**
